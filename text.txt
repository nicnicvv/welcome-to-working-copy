s strings) would be to loop over its indexes and call getString on the array for each index:

val my_json = result.get().obj()
val items = my_json.getJSONArray("items")

for (i in 0 until items.length()) {
    val item = items.getString(i)
    // use item
}
If you don't want to deal with indexes while iterating, you could wrap the iteration of a JSONArray into an extension function:

fun JSONArray.forEachString(action: (String) -> Unit) {
    for (i in 0 until length()) {
        action(getString(i))
    }
}
Which could then be used like this:

val items = my_json.getJSONArray("items")
items.forEachString { item ->
    // use item
}
You could extend the JSONArray class with an iterator function as well if
